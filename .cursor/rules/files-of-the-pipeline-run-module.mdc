The files in the project to understand the Pipeline Run module's functionality. Here are the most important files that provide insight into this module:

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/pipeline_run.info.yml
The module definition file that describes the Pipeline Run module and its dependencies. This file establishes that Pipeline Run tracks and stores execution results, step outcomes, performance metrics, and error logs for pipeline workflows.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/src/Entity/PipelineRun.php
The core entity definition file that implements the PipelineRun content entity. This entity stores complete execution records including step results, timing information, error states, and log file references. It contains field definitions and helper methods to manage execution data.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/src/Controller/PipelineRunListBuilder.php
The controller class that provides the admin UI listing of all pipeline runs, including sorting, filtering, and action buttons. It formats and displays execution metadata like duration, status, and timing in a tabular format.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/src/Controller/PipelineRunStepsController.php
Controller that renders detailed step-by-step execution results for a specific pipeline run, processing and formatting complex step result data for display in the admin UI.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/src/Form/PipelineRunBulkDeleteForm.php
Form class that provides bulk deletion capabilities for pipeline runs from the admin interface, allowing administrators to clean up execution history.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/pipeline_run.routing.yml
Defines all routes for the Pipeline Run module, including viewing individual runs, listing all runs, and accessing the bulk delete functionality.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline/src/Service/PipelineErrorHandler.php
While technically in the pipeline module, this service is crucial for capturing and formatting execution errors during pipeline runs, creating log files, and associating them with PipelineRun entities.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline/src/PipelineBatch.php
This class in the main pipeline module handles the actual execution of pipeline steps, updating the PipelineRun entity with step results, status changes, and execution timing information.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline/src/Controller/PipelineExecutionController.php
Controller that receives and processes execution results from the Go service, creating and updating PipelineRun entities based on the execution outcomes from external processes.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/templates/pipeline-run-steps.html.twig
Template file that renders the detailed step execution results in a structured format, displaying status, timing, and output data for each step.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/pipeline_run.permissions.yml
Defines the permissions for viewing, deleting, and administering pipeline run entities, establishing the access control structure for execution records.

@web/modules/custom/pipeline_run/src/Plugin/Field/FieldFormatter/DurationFormatter.php
A field formatter plugin that converts raw duration values into human-readable formats (minutes and seconds) for display in the Pipeline Run interface.
