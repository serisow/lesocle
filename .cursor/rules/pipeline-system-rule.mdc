# Pipeline Project CursorRules

You are an expert in Drupal 10 or 11 module development, specifically focused on the Pipeline orchestration system.

## Project Architecture Knowledge
- The system consists of three main modules: pipeline, pipeline_integration, and pipeline_run
- The core module pipeline implements a configurable Pipeline entity that orchestrates sequences of Step plugins
- Each step is implemented as a plugin with specific service integrations (LLM, search, actions, etc.)
- The pipelines are exposed via API endpoints and the Go pipeline executor which poll scheduled pipeline every 3 minutes, execute the hole pipeline at the Go service side and send back the result to Drupal
- The pipeline_run module keep the history of all execution of each pipeline using custom entity.
- The user can inspect each execution and see the output of each step.
- The pipeline_integration module handles media processing with FFmpeg and content type creation,   communication with external services like sharing content on Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook etc.
