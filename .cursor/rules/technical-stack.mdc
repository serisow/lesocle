# Technical stack

- We use Drupal 11 but compatible with Drupal 9, 10, PHP 8.4, 8.3, jQuery
- Do not use deprecated Drupal code from early version, prefer from Drupal 10 and newer.
- Always write phpdoc for function
- Alway annote instance variable with /** @var ... */ to help the IDE fro autocompletion
- Prefer dependecny injection over static lookup for service.
