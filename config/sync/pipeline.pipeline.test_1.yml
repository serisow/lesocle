        After performing an extensive research, one of the promising products that fits your requirements is 'French Skincare Products'. French skincare is known for its high quality ingredients and efficiency. They are highly sought after globally, especially in emerging markets like Senegal.

        Reasons to choose skincare products:
        1. Smaller size for ease in transport: Skincare items such as facial creams, serums, sunscreens, and lotions come in compact sizes which make them ideal for transportation.
        2. High demand: French skincare brands hold prestige and are found to be quite popular in various countries. Hence, they could fetch good prices outside France.
        3. Good profit margin: Depending upon the brand and type of product, many of these items can be bought for under 100 Euros in France and sold at a higher price in Senegal due to their imported nature.

        Some suggested brands are:
        1. Nuxe - Known for their plant concentrate products and honey lip balm.
        2. Bioderma - Their Sensibio H20 micellar water is a best-seller globally.
        3. La Roche-Posay – Internationally recommended by dermatologists, their thermal spring water spray and face serums are high demand products.
        4. Caudalie – Renowned for their products harnessing the power of grapes and viniferine.
        5. Avene – Hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic products for sensitive skin.
        6. Vichy - Renowned for their face masks and Aqualia Thermal serum.

        You can buy these products from any pharmacy in France or online. The market for these products is growing in Senegal, so you can expect a good profit margin. For selling them, you can consider opening an online store or link up with local beauty salons, spas, and shops.

        Remember when transporting the items, make sure you're adhering to any guidelines or regulations for transport of personal and commercial items in both France and Senegal. Also remember to consider import/export taxes and duties when calculating the profit.
